Kansas Call Center Service Request Analysis
This GitHub repository contains a comprehensive analysis of service request data from a Kansas call center spanning the years 2018 to 2021. The analysis focuses on several key business requirements to provide insights into service request trends, source volumes, departmental workload, performance metrics, response times, and closure times. The analysis is presented through interactive dashboards created using data visualization tools.

-Service Requests Over Time:Examines the overall trend in service requests from 2018 to 2021 and how they have changed on a monthly basis.

-Volume of Service Requests by Source: Analyzes the volume of service requests received from different sources to identify trends over time.

-Volume of Service Requests by Department: Investigates the volume of service requests received by different departments to understand workload distribution.

-Top 10 Performance Metrics (Response Time) by Category and Type: Identifies the top 10 cases with the fastest response times, categorized by category and type of request.

-Geographical Visualization: Highlights the top 10 areas where the most service requests were raised through geographical visualization.

-Departmental Workload Comparison: Visualizes the workload variation among different departments and workgroups to understand distribution.

-Response Time Analysis: Visualizes the distribution of response times for each department to identify outliers or patterns.

-Service Request Status Composition: Creates a visualization to show the composition of service request statuses (open, closed, in progress) and how it has changed over the years.

-Time to Closure Analysis: Visualizes the average days to close service requests for each category, identifying categories with consistently longer closure times.
-Workload Efficiency: Creates a visualization to illustrate the relationship between workload (number of service requests) and efficiency (days to close) for each department.
